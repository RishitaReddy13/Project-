Objective
Phishing is a type of fraud in which an attacker impersonates a reputable company or person in order to get sensitive information such as login credentials or account information via email or other communication channels.Phishing is popular among attackers because it is easier to persuade someone to click a malicious link that appears to be authentic than it is to break through a computer's protection measures.
The main goal of this project is to create a domain authentication system that would detect if a given domain url is legit or fake website created to perform fraud. Multiple ML models will be tested for this problem. A web Interface along with suitable Rest-API's will be created for commercial use.
